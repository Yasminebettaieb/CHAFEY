1) #### the path in order for the file to work is this :
   - create a file seperate (dog-breed-identification) open it and add : ( Test, train , labels , sample_submission) and all of these files are here "https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadikaljarif/dog-breed-identification/input"
   - Unzip the files and now you run ipynb file.
     I didnt include the files because They were too large.
